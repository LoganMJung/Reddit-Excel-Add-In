Sometime ago /u/norsk  and **/u/BornOnFeb2nd** wrote out a macro that allows you to highlight a selected section and it would convert the table to an excel table.  The mods and I were discussing creating this (before I knew that /u/norsk **/u/BornOnFeb2nd** had already written one) and /u/vertexvortex pointed us in the way.

Well we have taken that macro and crated the first /r/Excel add-in.  It has been tested in 2007/2010/**2013** (Thanks /u/bakuj) and works as described.

**Unfortunatly at this time we are unable to test/debug a version for for Mac users, as soon as we have this solved we will make a post.**

Since this is an add-in you will need to be sure that you enabled it in your add-ins.  What it will do is create a tool bar and a command button for the macro.  /u/vertexvortex has made a few additions to the code that will also allow you use reddit formatting in the table.

The way it works, is type out your "sample" table, highlight it and run the macro.  The table must be at least ~~4x4~~ 2x2.  It will copy the data to your clipboard, and all you need to do is paste it in reddit and the table should be created for you.

Hope this helps with posting data, and again a big thanks to /u/norsk,  **/u/BornOnFeb2nd**, and /u/vertexvortex for putting this together!
